# Contributing to AI4-Dashboard
Thank you for taking the time in contributing to our project, we love your input!
Before starting, be sure to read our [Read our Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ai4os/ai4-dashboard/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), to ensure that all code changes happens through an approved and reviewed pull request
Pull requests are very welcomed! to create one you should:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If needed, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use the [official Angular code style](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) plus a couple of things that you have to take into account

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs 
* We use pre-commits hooks using husky that will lint your code and run all the test
  * If you want to run this by yourself you can run npm lint and npm test respectively 

## Did you find a bug? Help us and the community by providing a detailed bug report

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
